*IMPORTANT NOTE*: These files run without the sudo cmd. If you have not configured your docker account to be in the docker group, you will need to edit these docker cmds to have "sudo" in front of "docker" in the .sh files. 

Step 1: Set up the subnet by running ./create_network.sh

Step 2: Build the "quickstart" image. This will be the image for both the master and the messengers.
The command is: 
	docker build -t quick_start <insert path to dockerfile>

Step 3: Spin up the master container by running ./spin_master.sh

Step 4: Spin up the messenger containers by running ./spin_msgs.sh

---TESTING--- *See important note at top of file for next cmd*
To see if it has correctly spun up messengers equal to the number of columns in data.csv, get a bash command line open in the master container.
To do the above, use this command: 
docker exec -it <insert master container name/id> /bin/bash -c "export TERM=xterm; exec bash"

Now if you ls, you should see a # of data files equal to the # of cols in data.csv.
cat these to the screen to verify correct output to each data file.
To exit the master container, type exit.

EXTRA NOTES:
to stop all contains: docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
to remove all contains: docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
to inspect subnet: docker network inspect mynet
to list running containers: docker ps
to list all containers: docker ps -a
to remove an image: docker image rm <image name>
to see images: docker images
to see all networks: docker network ls

we could make a master subdirectory so that the master container doesn't copy all the files (including importantly data.csv) within our main directory when we spin the master. (We would have a second dockerfile inside the master directory, along with a requirements.txt and master.py)
